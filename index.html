		Hello! My name is Eli Moreira and I am a software developer, currently studying in the Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.
	 </p>
	 <p class="bio">
		Throughout my studies, I have worked on many projects including, but not limited to, a web tool for easy examination of tests directed at new teachers,
		two entertainment web apps for iOS, a small but robust visual novel videogame, another small 3D free-roam videogame made in Unity, and a prototype python 
		compiler based on ply. My main programming language at the moment is C++, but I have dabbled in Java and Python.
	 </p>
	 <p class="bio">
		I am very excited to continue to learn the ins and outs of html web app development combined with css styling and javascript integrated functionality, back end and
		front end development, web page deployment, and use of APIs among other things in this class during the summer course.
